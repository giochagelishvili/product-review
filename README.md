# Product Review Webpage
Product review webpage developed using HTML &amp; CSS.

During my web development journey, I had the pleasure of discovering a visually stunning design on Figma that inspired me to recreate it as a responsive, interactive webpage. Using a combination of flexbox and grid, I worked diligently to bring this design to life while ensuring that the layout remained responsive across various screen sizes.

Despite the challenges presented by the design's complexity, I persevered and produced a final product that met my standards of quality and functionality. With its interactive features and responsive layout, the webpage provides an engaging and seamless user experience for desktop devices.

Overall, I found this project to be a highly enjoyable and rewarding experience that helped me to expand my skill set as a web developer.
